# Importing data into R

The thing that makes R so powerful is its use of packages. These are programs that others have created that can help make your life a little easier. When you download R, it comes with a number of packages already installed. Others you have to download. Below we're going to use a package called [haven] (https://github.com/tidyverse/haven), which allows you to import data formatted for SPSS, Stata and SAS --- some of the most popular statistical packages. 

## Install haven 

Frequently packages have instructions on how to install them. haven is [no different](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven#installation). Take a look. Then enter the below code in R. 

```
install.packages("haven")
```
