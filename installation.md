# First things first 

Before we can dive in and start analyzing data, there's some housekeeping tasks we have to do. Namely, install the software. 

## Installation

Follow the directions for your operating system. 

### Mac


### Windows 

The first thing you need to do is install R. Follow [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/) and click on the "install R for the first time."  

OK. Now that's done. What we've done is install R. At this point, you could go to the Start menu and start up R. But I'm not a big fan of that GUI. Instead, let's use RStudio. Let's go to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and download the desktop version. 

You'll want to make sure you grab the open source version.
